Hi

I created an encryption/decryption program in python just for the fun of it.
The encryption/decryption in based on the enigma.

You enter a .txt file and it spits out a .xic file.
you can then enter the .xic file to reverse the encryption

In engine.py are all the defs needed for this.
My coding is still far from great, but was a great challenge to code this program.
in some places there will probably be some things that are from testing and trouble shooting that I overlooked.

If you have suggestions on how to improve be sure to let me know!

Kind regards!
